### Linkedin Oil & Gas Production Transformation Logo

The icon represents the idea that production is transforming, becoming more granular and detailed. The simple diamond shapes echo other valuable resources that are taken out of the ground. The colors are inspired by oil and gas production graphs where Oil is green and Gas is red. Water in the context of oil, especially unconventional oil is  a controversial public issue, and is omitting so that the focus can remain on solving production problems and not worrying about environmental issues.

The Typeface, [Alternate Gothic No 1][agn1], was designed by [Morris Fuller Beton][mfb] in 1903. It’s simple lines and uncomplicated shapes make it timeless. Where some of Alternate Gothic No. 1’s contemporary typefaces attempted to predict the future (the aptly named [Futura][ft]) or cling to a glamorized past ([Bodoni][bd]), Alternative Gothic No. 1’s simplicity makes it the perfect foundation to build upon, much like the group hopes to do.

### One Virtual Source - Jones Asset & Well System

Jones Asset & Well System is a backcronym used to describe [Jones Energy][jones]'s One Virtual Source project. The logo is a dirivative piece based on the [movie poster][jawsp] for the 1975 film [Jaws][jawsm]. The geometric shapes in the icon are displayed in colors derived from Jones' logo and represent teeth in a shark's mouth. The typeface is [Tw Cen MT][twcenmt] and was chosen because of it's geometry and availablity on the computers the solution will be installed on. The type is positioned inside the mouth, an homage to the scene in [Jaws where the shark attacks the boat][sharkatk].

### Beyond Analytics - Currently Unused

OVS Group wanted to differentiate their product from other competing tools. The project is designed to instill the idea that analytics is a basic checkbox feature, but what One Virtual Source provides is essential to the process. Beyond Analytics uses a mix of tongue-in-cheek humor and bold statements to capture the attention of the viewer and get them to ask why.

### Marketing collateral

The marketing collateral for OVS Group is constructed to be a modular and technical overview of the software they provide. The sales and engineering teams update and change the materials they would like to focus on while wishing to maintain a library of sheets to answer any questions a prospect or client might have. Because of the fluid nature of the content, a folder with indiviual pages was chosen to defray costs and make the collateral system more reusable.

### iOS App - Production Status Unknown

Technical challenges prevented the One Virtual Source iOS app from being developed, but the first round of design was completed and approved. While not comprehensive the design sets a visual language for use cases within the One Virtual Source sofware.

### Tradeshow Booth

OVS Group wanted to redesign it's trade show booth. After a study of other booths, management decided they would like to use the image of computer generated man overseeing digital assets. It was my responsibility to take that image and work with a [marketing consultant][misterbill] who was intimately familiar with the demographic to create an eye catching trade show presence. After it's debut the sales team reported a notable increase in foot traffic through the booth as well as several other companies attempting to copy the visual style.

### Popup banners

Executive management wanted a way to bring marketing materials into environments where it was impractical to place their trade show booth. Several popup banners were created to flank a stand mounted television which is used during presentations and demos.

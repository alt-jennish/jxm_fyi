Summary: OVS Group's Tradeshow Booth

My first major project at OVS Group was to redesign their tradeshow booth. Their sales team had a great deal of success presenting at tradeshows and part of their 2013 plan was to increase their presence.

Research for the project proved to be difficult. Photography is banned at most Oil &amp; Gas tradeshows and guests are regularly asked to leave for violating that rule. The sales team was unwilling to risk getting kicked out so I had to travel to several local tradeshows in person to research the design trends in that market. I actually got kicked out myself when I tried to surreptitiously photograph a few examples for reference.

Eventually I was able to compile enough information to create an engaging booth for OVS Group. It was an interesting design project. Tradeshow booths and other physical assets like it have some nuanced requirements that can trip you up if you're not careful. A normal printed piece of the size of a typical tradeshow panel is designed to be viewed from a distance and can be printed in lower fidelity. However a tradeshow booth must stand up to inspection at viewing distances of a few feet. Much of the imagery used for the booth assets had to be vectorized and tweaked manually to meet the recommended specs from the printer.

The booth was designed with several configurations. OVS Group typically purchased 10x10 spaces at tradeshows but there were several where they opted for a 10x20 booth instead. Working with the vendor I generated several additional assets that could be placed in extension panels to fill out the booth at it's largest configuration.

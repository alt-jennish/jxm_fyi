Jaws: Jones Asset &amp; Well Systems
====================================

Jones Asset & Well System is a backcronym used to describe [Jones Energy's][jones] One Virtual Source project. The logo is a derivative piece based on the [movie poster][poster] for the 1975 film [Jaws][jaws]. The geometric shapes in the icon are displayed in colors derived from Jones' logo and represent teeth in a shark's mouth. The typeface is [Tw Cen MT][twenty] and was chosen because of it's geometry and availability on the computers the solution will be installed on. The type is positioned inside the mouth, an homage to the scene in Jaws [where the shark attacks the boat][scene].

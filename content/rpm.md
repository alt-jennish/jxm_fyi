Summary: Icon for use at small sizes

RPM needed a logo that could be used for small applications, such as favicons and embroidered applications. To start the project I took stock of RPM's brand identity and examined how it could be simplified for display at small sizes.

Prior RPM Logos

### RPM's Primary Logo

### RPM's Alternate Mark

The two primary elements, the icon and the type, have their flaws, but provided a servicable foundation for the project. After multiple sketches and careful analysis I determined that the type would have to be omitted to fit the extremely tight size requirements. The icon, which mimics a tacometer, provided more opportunity for revision. I chose to simplify the geometry and thicken the line to make it readable at small size. My original pitches removed the gradient, but the stakeholders felt strongly that it should be preserved. The final version of the new logos were very successful and well loved by the stakeholders

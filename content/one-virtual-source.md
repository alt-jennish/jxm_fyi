Summary: One Virtual Source User Interface

One Virtual Source (OVS) is an Oil &amp; Gas software tool that helps petroleum engineers optimize their production. It works on the principle of surveillance by exception where the user's attention is only directed to things that are not behaving as intended.

Users are presented with numerous tools that help them keep their operations running smoothly, including a limited social network that treats assets and entities (digital representations of physical devices) as anchors that conversations can be had around.

It also provides tools for projecting the long term output of wells that greatly increase the speed at which oilfield personnel are able to operate. It is a valuable tool for extraction companies who face great political pressure to drill less and whose workforce is rather expensive. It allows these operations to extract more oil and gas with fewer wells and engineers.

Forecasting is an important part of the petroleum engineer's work and OVS provides them with some of the most accurate forecasting modules available.

In addition to providing tools for engineers to perform their jobs, it is also an incredibly useful tool for oilfield technicians to monitor the assets they're in charge of.

One Virtual Source, and in fact working for OVS Group at all, posed some serious ethical problems for me. I was concerned that I would be directly contributing to the environmental problems caused by oil extraction. However the One Virtual Source application promises to actually reduce the environmental impact of drilling and hydraulic fracturing (commonly known as fracking), by making existing wells more efficient. This ultimately leads to fewer wells being drilled and fracked. Admittedly, that's a bit of fancy mental gymnastics.

The original interface this design replaced was a set of winforms whose usage could only be divined by consulting a physical manual. I was unable to speak with any users to research their requirements, but based on extensive interviews of staff petroleum engineers I derived a UX that greatly simplified the regular tasks a user of the system performed.

I added analytics to the software as well to observe and monitor user and continually refine the experience over several months. This design also served as the basis for the web version of the tool, which was in active development when I left OVS Group.

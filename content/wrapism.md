Summary: Susan Petty's custom gift wrapping portfolio

![wrapism-home]({static}images/wrapism-home.png)

[wrapism.com][wrapism] is a creative project by Susan Petty that showcases her package wrapping art. Susan and I worked together to create a place on the web that is unobtrusive so her projects shine.

We decided to create the site using Wordpress so Susan could easily add or remove pages as she needed. I trained her briefly on how to use wordpress and how to style her posts, but she was a quick study.

Part of the [Beckinfield][becki] project was generating weekly images and illustrations for the story newsletter. One such image was the campaign ephemera for an eccentric character known as "Greybeard". He was a burned out hippy who never spoke and gave everyone he met freshly baked cookies. The campaign spanned several months and the assets generated were used frequently during that time.

Actors in the series were provided with several assets they could use to lend verisimilitude to their productions. The most popular of these was a button. One of the actors had a button machine and created dozens which she mailed out to other performers.

Greybeard lost the campaign, but his collateral lives on as a fond memory.

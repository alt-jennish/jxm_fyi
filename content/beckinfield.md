Summary: Beckinfield was a Mass Participation Television project

Beckinfield was a Mass Participation Television project created by [Bob Gebert][bob] and Tracy Evans. It was an experiment to see if multiple, changing actors could stitch together a cohesive narrative. Each week, actors were sent a newsletter filled with the story of a fictional town called Beckinfield located in Northern California along with suggestions for how to make videos for each story point. Actors would create videos, usually vlog style, reacting and reporting on the story while weaving their own character's narrative in.

Each actor made their own character, created their own stories, and filmed their own videos. Theatrics, the company running Beckinfield, attempted to provide guidance and support by hiring Hollywood insiders like writer [Marc Scott Zicree][msz] and [Scott David][sd] to provide guidance and support for the userbase.

Each week, the <q>Episode</q> was compiled and published. When I started at Theatrics in 2010, the layout was a skeuomorphic design resembling a traditional newspaper. Developing each week's episode took several days as the classic layout had to be done by hand (imagine manually balancing text columns). Between that and the handcoded email newsletter, my entire job was mostly publishing these two pieces. I developed a lot of templates and reusable code blocks to speed up the process and eventually modernized the design. The new episode layout was templatized and reduced the time required to publish from roughly 16 hours, to less than 4 and allowed the staff writer to edit copy without requiring a full code push.

The final marketing push for Beckinfield was hiring [Jonathan Frakes][jf] to promote and judge a contest that rewarded the winner with $10,000.

The campaign was very successful and a lot of fun to design and participate in. The success of the campaign inspired a weekly award project to motivate and reward the users.

Beckinfield was a fun project to work on and I learned a lot about design, code, and user interfaces while there. My only regret was not doing a good enough job archiving my work. Theatrics.com LLC went out of business in 2014 and the hundreds of images, newsletters, and pages I designed are lost to history.

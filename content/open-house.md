Summary: A look at the redesign process

Once I familiarized myself with RPM's brand and felt confident that I understood its identity, I began redesigning previously created artifacts. One such example is the open house flyer that is used to attract new employees. The original design had some issues that I hoped to solve with a redesign.

Original Design

There were a lot of elements competing for attention that reduced the efficacy of the piece. Additionally the bokeh background was completely unique to this piece and operated counter the gritty brand RPM had established. To start I removed as much of the ornamentation as I could and introduced a typographic grid.

Already that made a dramatic improvement in the ability of the piece to communicate its message. It was too minimal though. It stripped out almost all of the brand identity and made the piece too generic. I decided to capitalize on some images I had created for another project and laid in a picture of Detroit to give it some character.

That hurt the readability of the composition. I decided to simplify it further by eliminating vestigial elements, such as the social media handles. After that, I played with the type until I ultimately landed on a final design that communicated the message, demonstrated RPM's grit, and preserved as much of the original design as possible.

Summary: RPM's Brand Guidelines

As RPM grew it became more and more important that it had a cohesive brand document to guide future marketing materials.

The unique voice and culture of RPM had to be distilled into a few paragraphs. The year I had spent working at RPM interviewing employees for promotional videos and sharing lunch with them gave me the perspective to see past the default "RPM is about People" mantra that is repeated by many employees when asked to describe the company. RPM is about people, but it's really about hard work and dedication.

Of course there is a lot of fun that happens at RPM as well. Trying to balance the work ethic and sense of humor at RPM is a balancing act.

The company's almost supernaturally fast growth has led to some unfortunate dilution of the brand. The marketing department often finds employees making their own materials because it's faster than going through the formal process. While not ideal, having brand guidelines keeps these rogue documents from getting too far out of line.

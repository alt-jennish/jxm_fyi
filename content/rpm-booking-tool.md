Summary: A tool for keeping track of the life cycle of a freight shipment

Project Lodestone, or The Booking Tool as it is known by it's users, is a tool that allows RPM's carrier relations team to keep track of freight shipments and automate some of the tedious parts of the process.

RPM's technology department historically had had a poor track record of rolling out and supporting new technology so another major part of the project was to improve the relationship with the rest of the company.

User Interviews
---------------

We began the project by interviewing members of the team to identify processes that could be improved or automated completely.

This was the first major undertaking of this kind at RPM and the organization had little institutional knowledge about how to conduct user research. We got started by interviewing users about what they thought technology could improve about their jobs.

Initially user interviews were conducted one on one. During the second week of interviews a scheduling conflict created a situation where two users only had the same time slot and were interviewed together. We discovered during that interview that having a peer familiar with their work process created a more dynamic dialogue. We decided to continue the remaining interviews as pairs.

In parallel, on another project we tested the idea of adding additional interviewees to the process, including a round table style process involving eight users, but found that two users from the same work group to be the most effective for gathering requirements and data.

The interview process yielded excellent results. We identified several key needs that could be addressed through software:

- Automate sending &amp; processing paperwork
- Make open loads (shipments without a truck assigned to them) easier to find
- Make it easier to find and book a carrier

Spec &amp; Design
-----------------

After collating the notes we took during the process my work partner and I set out to design a system that would address the needs we identified. During the brainstorming process we took on roles to help structure the discussion in a more productive fashion. I advocated for what was in the best interest of the user and my partner took on the role of advocating for the best interests of the company.

From the notes and sketches we created during the brainstorming process I created more formal sketches of the user interface.

User Interviews, Part Two
-------------------------

Armed with the sketches, I returned to the users. I re-interviewed each pair and presented them with the UI sketches and asked for their feedback. The initial round of interviews was marked by reserved skepticism. But being brought back for a second round of interviews and presented with sketches that addressed their needs dramatically improved the users outlook and perception of the project in almost every case.

We performed three rounds of these interviews, and between each round I revised the mock ups and added more details.

In hindsight, we might have spent too much time in this phase, but the results were worth it. The tool, as spec'ed, had the users excited and approaching members of the IT staff asking for updates on the progress.

Presenting The Findings
-----------------------

My partner &amp; I took our findings to the CTO and a Senior Developer for review. We presented the designs and discussed their thoughts, impressions, and insights into the development challenges the project would face. 

The meeting went well. The CTO and Senior Developer had concerns about how much time it would take to implement the tool and so we left the meeting with instructions to break the tool down into smaller feature sets that could be released as major versions.

After we submitted our roadmap to the CTO, he took it and presented it to the rest of the executive team. The executive team had already heard of the tool and were excited, thanks to the interest and buzz we had generated during the interview process.

High Fidelity Mock Ups
----------------------

The executive team approved the project and I created high fidelity mock ups of the first version of the tool. To make sure we hadn't lost too much usefulness during the paring down process, I conducted a final series of user interviews.

After the interviews, I organized the development team's kick off and walked them through the details of the tool.

Results
-------

Project Lodestone was a resounding success. During beta testing, we found that the tool saved users, on average, 4 hours per day, which freed them up to book more loads, manage their carrier relationships more effectively, and allowed the beta work group to catch up on work that had been neglected because the team was overworked.

The tool is still in the process of being rolled out company wide, but already RPM is seeing more effective utilization of it's staff. The staff are happier because they don't have to put in as much overtime to get their work done. That's what I'm the most proud of.

Summary: OVS Group's showcase booklet for it's workflows

OVS Group needed a way to easily showcase its robust workflow library. The sales team attended a large number of tradeshows each year and their target market is older so it was decided a booklet would be the most effective tool to reach that audience. The project was ambitious, but had some obstacles. Very little of the content that was required for the piece existed prior to starting work on the project and staff limitations meant the task of compiling, writing, and editing fell to me.

With several dozen workflows, the task of compiling each of the highly technical documentation was daunting. I worked with several developers and petroleum engineers to ensure the data was accurate and each screenshot, graph, and illustration was accurate and compelling for the intended audience.

Many of the workflows OVS Group had available did not exist with demo data. Many of the screenshots had to be taken from live projects and doctored to obfuscate the proprietary data of the oil companies who used them. In some instances the entire user interface had to be reconstructed from scratch because of NDA's and corporate branding.

The front section of the book was easier. It contained a general marketing pitch for the software as a whole. As part of a previous website redesign I had generated a set of verbs, branding, and illustrations that could be repurposed for print applications.

The illustration work was complex and presented some unique challenges. The intended audience of the publication was a highly technical group. One where a master's degree would be considered barely educated. For one illustration, which I call "Assets in their Environment", I had to consult with a geologist and revised the illustation several times to portray an accurate cross section of the earth's crust.

That particular illustration was very popular with Geologists and Petroleum Engineers and two of OVS Group's clients requested posters of it.

The project also presented a unique challenge for the printer. The document was short, only 32 pages. On the glossy bond paper I had selected it was too thin for their binding machine. Working with the printer I selected heavier paper, but even that didn't increase the width of the booklet enough to fit thier machinery. But thanks to an experienced technician, they developed an ingenious paper shim to keep the pages together while it travelled through the binder and still produce a professional print.

They were so proud of the work they had done on the project they overprinted the order by several hundred and added the extras to their kit of samples.

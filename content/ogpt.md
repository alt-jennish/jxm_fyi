Oil & Gas Production Transformation is a Linkedin group created to promote dicussion for better optimization practices within the oil & gas industry.
 
 The icon represents the idea that production is transforming; becoming more granular and detailed. The simple diamond shapes echo valuable resources that are taken out of the ground. The colors are inspired by oil and gas production graphs where Oil is green and Gas is red.
  
  The Typeface, [Alternate Gothic No 1][agn1], was designed by [Morris Fuller Beton][mfb] in 1903. Its simple lines and uncomplicated shapes make it timeless. Where some of its contemporary typefaces attempted to predict the future or cling to a glamorized past, Alternative Gothic No. 1â€™s simplicity makes it the perfect foundation to build upon.

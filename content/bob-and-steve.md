Bob &amp; Steve Games
=====================

Bob &amp; Steve Games was an online gaming store. It specialized in Tabletop Roleplaying Games, Trading Card Games, and Collectible Card Games. The logo was intended to evoke the playfulness of the owners, while tying them concretely to the products they sell. Both avatars are abstractions of dice used in the game Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
